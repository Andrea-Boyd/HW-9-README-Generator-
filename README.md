# Homework 9: README Generator 

## Description:
The purpose of this homework is to generate a quality README with information about an open source project on GitHub-- what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. In this homework, this is being accomplished through a command-line application that will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This allows a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

The task of this homework is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The application is invoked with the following command:

```
node index.js
```

Because this is a command-line application that wonâ€™t be deployed, this link provides a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of my application: 



## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added hear the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
